# Simple React Boilerplate

This is a simple barebones boilerplate of a React project that implements [styled components](https://www.styled-components.com/) and [icons](https://styled-icons.js.org/).

Features include:

- Modern ECMAscript compatiblity ( using JavaScript compiler [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) )
- Webpack / Npm configuration
- Sass / Scss compatible
- Basic JavaScript / React linting configuration
- Autoprefixing and minification of stylesheets
- Simple image handling using file-loader
- Custom favicon compatibility using html-webpack-plugin

**Note:** This is simply a front end boilerplate, it does not implement any state management such as **Redux**, any databases, or backend code.
